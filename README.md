# 3D Coverage Heatmap

Our project accurately simulates signal decay through obstacles, providing intensity estimates at each point. With support for real-time computation on mobile devices and easily extendable modules for complex scenarios, it offers a comprehensive toolkit for exploring signal transmission dynamics.

# Implementation Details

For each fragment $i$, we perform raycasting $R_{i,j}$ from signal $j$, computing intersections with axis-aligned bounding boxes (AABBs) and triangles to separate into airborne ${A_{i,j}}$ and obstacle ${O_{i,j}}$ components.

Next, we calculate the signal intensity $ùëÜ_{fragment_i}$ of the fragment using two decay functions: $decay(S,D)$, which considers the original signal intensity $S_j$ and the airborne distance $length({A}_{i,j})$. and $attenuation(AABBs,Triangles,L)$, which accounts for spatial obstacles such as AABBs and triangles along the ray's path through the solid object.

$Decay_{i,j} = {decay}(S_{j}, length({A}_{i,j}))$

$Attenuation_{i,j} = \sum_{k} \ attenuation(AABB_k,Triangle_k,length(O_{i,j}))$

$S_{fragment_i} = \max_j (Decay_{i,j}-Attenuation_{i,j})$
